## The Journey
I created this website because I was tired of just creating things and letting them stay on my device until they are deleted or until they seem not to be interesting.

I got the confidence to deploy things after a project  my friends and I did based on a CS module called Software Design.
[Project link](https://github.com/Heisenburg-z/Sectional-titles-property-management.git) 

The project was based on Sectional Titles and Property Management.We used *React 16* (JavaScript) , *Azure* Server-less functions for our API and *Firebase* fire-store as storage. I enjoyed learning JavaScript because I had tried learning it on my own and got bored. I then got inspired to go a little deep into Web-Dev using Typescript.

I learnt Typescript in one day (*at least the fundamental staff*) and then got inspiration to learn *Next.js* that same week. I learnt the basics of Next.js, enough for me to just create my own simplistic website. I initially had created my website using [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) a *rust* web framework. I don't really know why I stopped because I had created everything I needed to have a website like this one. I think I made a decision in my mind to just use a developed ecosystem for the web instead of using rust for everything lollll!.

## The Website
Next.js was used as mentioned above, with Typescript as the language of choice. 
The blog section, I watched a YouTube video by [Jolly Coding](https://youtu.be/tSI98g3PDyE?si=HkJCmfUTtiNufzds), an impressive developer by the way. Shout out to him for the video!!!
I had struggled to setup a markdown blogging site using `.mdx` because the only thing I saw on YouTube was on how to set it up using `contentlayer`. Using `contentlayer` gave me problems that made me to feel like I was going in circles. I kept searching for a solution until I stumbled on Jolly Coding's video on how to make a blogging site.

## What Next ?
I'm still a undergraduate student at Wits, so will probably get cool and hard things to work on by the Grace of God. What will I be using ? mainly *rust*. I want to further my problem solving skills using rust as my primary language. I will keep learning Next.js just to get some freelance jobs on making websites lol, don't know if there are people still interested in this. I want to create projects based on data engineering too using *rust* as I'm a Applied Mathematics Student.


See you champs, until next time üí™üèæ !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
